# Supervised learning in R

In this project, we will predict student performance using various characteristics of the students. The training and test datasets are provided under the same folder in my Git Hub. 

We want to predict the variable "score" for the students in the test data. Our performance metric is the mean squared error.

Throughout this project, we first explore the data and visualize some summary statistics of the training set. Then, we will train and evaluate the performance of different classic machine learning algorithms and select the highest-performing model.
